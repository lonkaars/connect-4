The new designs can be found on
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rTciVQApAe6cwrH1Prl5Wn/4-op-een-rij?node-id=0%3A1).
The Figma designs are in dark mode, but the website will (for now) still have
light mode as it's default theme.

I'm now working on the new theming settings, and allow custom themes to be
created with css that can easily be selected in the settings page instead of
having to copy-paste color codes manually.

There are utility styles in ./utility.css. These are supposed to mimick
something like tailwind css. Most styles from the style guide are also defined
in ./global.css.
