[meta]: <title> (Privacy)

**We don't sell your data.** All data we collect is explicitly given to us by
you, or collected to improve website security (see below). Privacy is an
inviolable right, and we try to be as open as possible when it comes to data
collection. All website source code is available publicly [on
GitHub](https://github.com/lonkaars/connect-4).

## Data this website collects and what it's used for

[c]: <c> (- **Your external ip adress**  
  When logging in or creating a new account, your ip adress gets sent to the
  server. Your ip adress is not stored in plain text, but is hashed. This is to
  prevent someone from using your token outside your network.)
- **Your email adress**  
  We store your email adress to validate ownership of that email account, and
  to send important messages. We don't have a newsletter.
- **Other indentifiable information**  
  All other forms of indentifiable information is explicitly given to us by
  you. This includes your status message, username, email and profile picture.

## How can I delete my data

All data that is requested to be changed by you is immediately overwritten.
*You currently can't delete your account.* This is intentional (for now),
because there are [multiple ways of handling user
deletion](https://github.com/lonkaars/connect-4/issues/7). When the website
goes out of beta, there will be frequent database backups, which means that
your data won't dissapear right away. We don't plan on keeping the backups for
longer than 72 hours.
