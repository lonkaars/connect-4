[meta]: <title> (Connect 4 beta!)

This project will from now on be hosted here as a beta until the website has
enough features to 'go live'. There are a lot of known bugs that need fixing.
If you encounter any bugs that aren't listed in this list or on GitHub issues,
please open a <a href="https://github.com/lonkaars/connect-4/issues/new"
target="_blank">new issue</a>.

- Voerbak's (connect 4 engine) win checking algorithm is broken, this causes
  some games to finish when no one has won. If this happens to you, please open
  a new issue on GitHub and link the game id (the `?id=...` part in your adress
  bar).
- The buttons and timer aren't implemented (except for the resign/leave game
  button) in the bottom bar when playing a game.
- Editing the game rules isn't implemented.

I'm working as hard as I can on this website, but I have school exams coming up
so I don't think development will be very active the coming month.
